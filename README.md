# screepsmod-web-client

WIP, no documentation yet, theres likely lots of bugs.

Install as a mod, then access at http://ip:21025/client/

I have also been threatened to be temp banned from slack by
SemperRabbit if I don't include a support button linking to
my Patreon. So since I haven't gotten that far yet in the 
client, maybe this will appease him :D
